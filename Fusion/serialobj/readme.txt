Serial Object
Version 1.0
www.wowbrowse.com/serial/

The Serial Object is a freeware extension for MMF2. You may use it in both commercial and non-commercial projects at no cost. I do ask that you credit me however somewhere in your application and/or documentation. I also ask that you not distribute this object as a part of any extension download service. An exception has been made for FusionUpdater. Please always link to this page when providing users downloads of the object.

====IMPORTANT NOTES====
> For The Serial Object to work on Vista machines the MMF "Execution Level" settings need to be changed to "As administrator".

> If you run a comparison condition with the BytesWaiting expression and do not limit it the port will not close when you run the close action. The BEST way to see if data is waiting is to use the "Data is waiting" condition.
